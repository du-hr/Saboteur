\section{Abstract}
The project is based on a on a specific version of a card game called Saboteur, which was first introduced back in 2004. In this version, there are 4 types of cards available, namely Tile, Malus, Bonus, Destroy, and Map, on a  restricted board of size (15,15). The goal of the project is to implement a computer agent with artificial intelligence called \mintinline{java}{StudentPlayer}, which is defined in \newline
\mintinline{java}{public class StudentPlayer extends SaboteurPlayer}.
\par Our strategy is a modified version of the local greedy search algorithm to head towards the gold nugget objectives, which is based on the knowledge of Hill Climbing and Local Optimization we learned in class. In addition, an idea of aggressive approach was also included. In short, our general strategy is to use the Map cards to find the location of the goal, drop cards that are deemed "discard-able" along the way (to maximize the chances of having a favourable hand), use the Malus cards aggressively whenever appropriate, and build a path with the best Tile card in hand, determined by the Local Optimization search, towards the goal.
\par There are many constrains to our project, both from the scope of the project itself and several external factors. In the end, the result we obtained was satisfactory. We had a success rate of 33.33\% from our testing rounds of play and we have satisfied all the requirements from the project specification document.

\par The counting logic is in the architecture block is summarized as following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item To make the counter reset synchronous, only one parameter 'clk' (decalred in Line \ref{clk}) is included in the sensitivity list of the process block in Line \ref{sl}.
  \item A conditional statement in Line \ref{rising} ensures that the counter logic only executes on the rising clock edge.
  \item The reset bit is checked in Line \ref{reset}. If it is high, the counter is reset to zero.
  \item The enable bit is verified in Line \ref{enable} before checking the counter step size.
  \item In Line \ref{over1} and \ref{over2}, we check if the the counter reaches the maximum value allowed in the respective rate. If that is the case, the counter is reset to zero.
  \item The output would always be even if the rate is 2-bit since the counter adds 2 to itself every time there is a rising-edge clock signal.
